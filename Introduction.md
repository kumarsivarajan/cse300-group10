# Introduction #

This project is created with the intention to help institutes in the process of hostel allocation to students using distance as the primary measurement.

# Aim #

The team aims at building a highly scalable and generic software which will allow custom data entry and custom allotment parameters.

# Details #

When ready this software will facilitate:
  * Registration form : Students can apply remotely through www.
  * Allocation : Software will try to allocate students based on distance.
  * Administration : An authorised administrator can approve or disapprove the allotment.
  * Status : A status report visible on the front-end.
  * Anonymous Reporting : Anybody can report false data entered by some student anonymously .

The software may/may not facilitate:
  * Room Preference : 1/2/3 occupancy rooms allotted based on preference.
  * Share With : Add partner of preference for shared room (all 2/3 occupants must agree).
  * Live Updates : Live update of vacant and occupied rooms in all buildings.
